  "summary": "Diff implements significant error-hardening and graceful-degradation changes (new error boundaries, safer GlobalErrorFallbackPage, SiteLayout/RecentOrdersMenu guards). However, it also includes multiple unrequested UI/theme and feature-level changes that go beyond the stated non-goals.",
