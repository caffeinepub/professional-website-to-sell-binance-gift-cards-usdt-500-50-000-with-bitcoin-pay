  "summary": "Implemented a global Binance-styled promo ticker, introduced an auto-refreshing BTC/USDT rate hook and integrated it into pricing displays, compacted denomination cards with Binance-themed styling, and (per SiteLayout summary) removed the caffeine.ai footer branding. Also includes several additional UI/robustness changes not requested (e.g., admin visibility logic, error boundary/hardening).",

    {
      "description": "Added new global error boundary/fallback behavior around the app (GlobalErrorBoundary/GlobalErrorFallbackPage).",
