  "summary": "Diff implements stable backend site-owner storage with new getSiteOwner/claimSiteOwner APIs and updates frontend admin-route guard + query hooks to detect unclaimed ownership and enable a claim flow. One extra backend behavior assigns an AccessControl admin role during ownership claim, which was not explicitly requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [],
  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "On ownership claim, backend also assigns an \"#admin\" role in the AccessControl system (in addition to persisting siteOwner), introducing role-management behavior not required by the request.",
      "reason": "REQ-21/REQ-22 only require persisting a single owner principal and using it as the source of truth for admin authorization, plus APIs to read/claim (and optionally transfer) ownership. The diff adds role assignment side effects beyond those requirements.",
